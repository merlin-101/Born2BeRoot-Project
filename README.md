# Born2BeRoot-Project
This document is a System Administration related project.

This project aims to introduce us to the wonderful world of virtualization.
I will create my first machine in VirtualBox (or UTM if I canâ€™t use VirtualBox) under specific instructions. 
Then, at the end of this project, I will be able to set up my own operating system while implementing strict rules.

As for the Bonus, we are supposed to create a few more partitions similar to the example, and create a functional Wordpress website with the services lighttpd, MariaDB, and PHP.
